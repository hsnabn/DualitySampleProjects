# duality-samples
This repository contains some sample projects made for the 2D game engine [Duality](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality).  
The samples in this repository use Duality 2.0.  
Contributions to this repository are welcome.

## Samples
Each sample contains a Visual Studio Project file that can be included and built in your Duality ProjectPlugins solution. The Content directory in each sample contains any resources required to use the sample, such as: Scenes, Sprites, Sounds et cetera. The contents of the Content directory can be placed in a Duality environment to use the sample.

Currently, this repository consists of:
* SceneTransitions sample

  ### SceneTransitions
  This sample demonstrates Duality's scene system. It shows the difference between simply switching another scene and disposing the current scene and then switching to another scene. It also shows off scene reloading and scene saving. You can also add an object to a random position on the screen.
